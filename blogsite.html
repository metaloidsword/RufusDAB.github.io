                        <h5>Analysis of what a Gameplay programmer is, what they do and what their role is in the industry. <span class="w3-opacity">Febuary 23, 2021</span></h5>

                        <p>
                            As a Gameplay programmer, you will be fine tuning the games code to make the experiance for the player the best it can be. Some examples of this could be the balancing of the game, making sure
                            all of the values of the game are adjusted based on feedback. Another example for the Gameplay programmer would be writing the code for the Gameplay experiance, taking the engine that is given
                            to them and creating the levels, the UI the player will see and the type of interaction system, be it combat, movement or something else. Gameplay programmers will be at the head of
                            managing what the player experiance will be.<br><br>

                            Some examples of Gameplay programming job descriptions.<br><br>

                            Two Point Studios:<br>
                            For this job description, like many others they are looking for knowledge of the game engine UNITY. Being a Gameply programmer with your role of directly creating the players experiance, having
                            knowledge of engine being used is extremely important. Another skill Two Point Studios are looking for is flexibility across languages, be it c#, python they want you to be able to reliably
                            switch between working with these languages multiple times a day. You are also expected to have the communication skills to work with the team, especially since because of your role you will
                            most likely be working with every department to create the best experiance.<br><br>

                            Cloud Imperium Games:<br>
                            For this job description, Cloud Imperium Games want you to be comfortable working with C++ in a large already constructed codebase. The job role is to create scalable and robust code that can be
                            used by other workers on the games, to identify developmental risks and obstacles and ways to circumvent them, work well with a team to peer review technical designs and documentation. They also
                            expect you to be able to explain solutions to other programmers and other discplines.<br><br>

                            Gameplay programmer salary:<br><br>

                            Using glassdoor as a reference we can see that the average of a Gameplay programmers salary could be &pound31,000. This number will obviously range depending on multiple factors. Some of these
                            factors are, your experiance in the industry and how many games you have worked on that were published, your ability to work on multiple languages, engines and even help the other disciplines
                            like engine programmers. The salary will increase based on the level of quality expected from the job role, for example a high end salary of a senior Gameplay programmer could be &pound45,000,
                            the salary's are also effected by the type of games that are being published by the company, for example a tripple-A publishing game company will give a higher salary but expect a higher level
                            of work.<br><br>

                            Points for aspiring Gameply programmers:<br><br>

                            As a Gameplay programmer you will be expected to work on multiple different discplines or focus on the players experiance. Having basic knowledge of multiple coding languages will make you
                            much more employable as it shows you can reliably learn new things. As you will be directly influencing the players experiance, you need to have a good understanding of how to create a interactive
                            systems for the experiance. Having the ability to use multiple game engines and being adaptable to swap between them with similar levels of quality, this will allow you to increase your job range,
                            some companies also use multiple engines and this will mean you can cover more projects. Having the ability to work and communicate with other people on a high level, being able to explain
                            your ideas, solutions and ways of implemenations to other people in a clean and concise way, this is highly useful as you will be working with people that dont have the same knowledge in the
                            field as you.<br><br>
